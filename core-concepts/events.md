**Events** are typed objects that flow through the graph. They represent everything that happens in the system, from a user saying "Hello" to an agent deciding to call a function.

<Note>
  See the full event definitions in the [source code](https://github.com/smallest-inc/smallest-python-sdk/blob/main/smallestai/atoms/agent/events.py).

## Structure

All events inherit from `SDKEvent`.

```python
class SDKEvent(TypedModel):
    id: str         # Unique ID
    type: str       # Event type identifier
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    metadata: Dict  # Optional metadata
```


## Common Events

| Event Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `SDKSystemLLMRequestEvent` | Contains the user's message/input. |
| `SDKAgentLLMResponseChunkEvent` | A text chunk generated by an agent. |
| `SDKSystemUserJoinedEvent` | Triggered when a client connects. |
| `SDKAgentEndCallEvent` | Signal to end the session. |

## Flow

1.  **Transport Layer**: Receives WebSocket message → Converts to `SDKEvent`.
2.  **Session**: Routes event to Root Nodes.
3.  **Nodes**: Process event → Emit new events to Children.
4.  **Sink**: Catches output events → Converts to WebSocket message → Sends to Client.
