## What are Events?

Events are typed message objects that flow between components in the system. They represent everything from a system initialization to a chunk of text generated by an LLM.

### Common Events

Imports are available in `smallestai.atoms.agent.events`.

*   `SDKSystemLLMRequestEvent`: Carries the context/messages calling for an LLM generation.
*   `SDKAgentLLMResponseChunkEvent`: Represents a piece of streamed text content.
*   `SDKSystemUserJoinedEvent`: Triggered when a client connects to the session.
*   `SDKAgentEndCallEvent`: Signal to terminate the session.

### Flow

1.  Transport (WebSocket) receives data -> Converts to Event.
2.  Session routes Event to Root Node(s).
3.  Nodes process Event -> Emit new Event(s) -> Sent to Children.
4.  Leaf Nodes (or any node) can send Events back to the Transport (to client).
