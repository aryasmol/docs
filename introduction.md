---

The Atoms SDK is the Python framework for building agents on the [Atoms platform](https://smallest.ai). It provides the primitives for low-latency, stateful AI applications—handling streaming audio, conversation state, and tool coordination so you can focus on your agent's logic.

- **Streaming First**: Real-time audio and text streams with < 500ms latency.
- **Interruptible**: Automatic handling of user interruptions during playback.
- **Composable**: Break complex behaviors into reusable [Nodes](/core-concepts/nodes).
- **Event Driven**: Unified [Event](/core-concepts/events) system for messages, signals, and tools.
