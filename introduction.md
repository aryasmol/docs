## Why Atoms?

Atoms addresses the complexity of modern AI applications by providing a structured, event-driven framework.

### Designed for Scale
Whether you are building valid customer support agents, sales bots, or complex internal tools, Atoms provides the primitives you need to scale from a single prompt to a thousand concurrent sessions.

### Key Capabilities
- **Event-driven**: Unified event model for user messages, system signals, and tool outputs.
- **Stateful Nodes**: Persistent context management across long-running sessions.
- **Flexible Routing**: Dynamic traffic control between specialized agents.
